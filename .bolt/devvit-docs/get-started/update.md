# Update your app

Manage your app versions and subreddit installations.

After you update your app, every subreddit that has installed your app has to be **manually updated** to the new version (don’t worry, this won’t last forever). To update your subreddit app installation:

1. Go to [My Communities](https://developers.reddit.com/my/communities) from the profile dropdown in the Developer Portal.
2. Click the community you want to view.
3. When a new version of an app is available for a given subreddit, you will see a blue **Update** button next to the app tile. Click the button and follow the prompts to upgrade each community.
